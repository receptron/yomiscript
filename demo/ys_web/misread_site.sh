# The misread page as a static site (Cloudflare Pages and the like): the page as index.html, its data, the original
# Kokoro's audio, the station announcement demo (announce.html), 青空朗読文庫 (aozora.html), and the headers that let onnxruntime use several
# threads. The packages and onnxruntime come from jsDelivr, the models from Hugging Face, so the site itself is about
# 7 MB.
# usage: sh misread_site.sh [dir]   (default out/misread; after node misread.mjs)
#        npx wrangler pages deploy out/misread --project-name <name>
